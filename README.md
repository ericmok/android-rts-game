Android RTS Game Primer

An Android game written from scratch. 

### What it currently looks like

### Create Your own Game

While the code may be a fair mess, at the very least, there is some decent boilerplate for a 2D game.

Edit the `GameLoop` for custom game logic. 
Because the code logic is fairly functional, it should be fairly doable to convert this project 
into a game of your own design. 


### Contribute

Contributions are welcome. The roadmap for this project is at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/r1JkwwR0/android-rts)
