 * An item to be renderable by the SimpleShaderBatch draw2d function <br/>

 * If the physics takes too long, the graphics thread should handle it. But if draw items require splitting into multiple sprites then what?<br/>
 * A problem: The TextureLoader belongs in the graphics, but we don't have access to it in game logic. So we hardcode some animation strings.
