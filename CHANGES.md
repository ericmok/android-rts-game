## Notes

### Version 0.2.3
- Removed old engine code!
- For this demo:
  - Changed/added some art assets
  - Tweaked attack range
  - DataLoader loads random units.
  - Game logic added to platoon
- Still unresolved: should units have one node per type
- Boids model roughly account for separation vs field force conflicts

### Version 0.2.2
- Experimental noteworthy engine moved to master
- Massive changes to boids model
  - Instead of forces, we work with desired velocities instead
- Much to deprecate for the next version
